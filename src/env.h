	environmental factors

	This include file gathers together environmental factors that
	are likely to change from one C compiler to another, or from
	one system to another.  Please refer to the installation
	notes for more information.

	for systems using the Make utility, the system name is set
	by the make script.
	other systems (such as the Mac) should put a define statement
	at the beginning of the file, as shown below
